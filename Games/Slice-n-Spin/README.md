# 🍉 Slice n Spin - Final Project 🍓

## Features

### 1. **🌙 Dark Theme Styling**
   - The game features a sleek dark theme with a background color of `#121212` and text in light color (`#f5f5f5`) for a modern, visually appealing look.

### 2. **🎮 Game Canvas**
   - The game is rendered on a responsive HTML5 canvas that covers the entire window size.
   - The canvas background is a dark shade (`#1e1e1e`), matching the overall dark theme.

### 3. **🍏 Fruits Falling from the Top**
   - Fruits are randomly created and fall from the top of the canvas.
   - Each fruit has a random size between 20px and 40px, and a random color chosen from a vibrant set: red 🍓 (`#ff4757`), orange 🍊 (`#ffa502`), blue 🫐 (`#1e90ff`), green 🍀 (`#2ed573`), and yellow 🍋 (`#eccc68`).
   - Fruits move upwards at random speeds for added variety and challenge.

### 4. **🖱️ Mouse Slicing Mechanic**
   - The player slices the fruits by moving the mouse over them.
   - When the mouse position intersects with a fruit’s radius, the fruit is "sliced," and the player's score increases.
   - Sliced fruits disappear from the canvas.

### 5. **🏆 Score Display**
   - The player’s score is displayed at the top-left corner of the screen in a bright yellow color (`#ffcc00`).
   - The score increases by 1 for each fruit that is sliced.

### 6. **🔄 Random Fruit Generation**
   - Fruits are randomly generated at intervals, adding an element of surprise and excitement to the game.

### 7. **❌ Fruit Removal**
   - Fruits that move off-screen (i.e., go above the canvas) are automatically removed to optimize game performance.

### 8. **📱 Responsive Design**
   - The canvas dynamically adjusts its size based on the browser window’s width and height, ensuring the game looks great on any device.

## Conclusion
This is the last project I made for this repository. It’s a fun and simple fruit-slicing game that combines basic game mechanics like random object generation, mouse interaction, and score tracking, all with a sleek dark theme. 🍉🎯
