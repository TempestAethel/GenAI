# 🌟 GenAI Repository 🌟

Welcome to the **GenAI** repository! This is a collection of games, projects, and experiments I generated using AI. While the core code was created with the help of AI, I dedicated considerable time to refine and modify it to ensure proper functionality. This project was born out of my curiosity to see how AI could assist in coding, and the results have been fascinating!

## 🚀 Overview

All projects in this repository are hosted on **GitHub Pages**. Feel free to explore and enjoy!

## 💎 My Favorite Time-Spent Projects 💎

Here are some of the projects I’ve spent the most time on, and I’m particularly proud of:

### 1. **Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe**  
[Play the Game](https://tempestaethel.github.io/GenAI/Games/TicTacToe/index.html)  
A Tic-Tac-Toe game with unbeatable AI! It uses the minimax algorithm to ensure that the computer never loses. I enjoyed fine-tuning the AI to make it as challenging as possible.

### 2. **Progress Knight**  
[Play the Game](https://tempestaethel.github.io/GenAI/Games/Progress-knight/index.html)  
This game allows you to progress through various levels. **Note**: This project is a small mod and was not AI-generated or created by me, but I had a lot of fun tweaking it and adding my personal touches.

### 3. **Simon Says**  
[Play the Game](https://tempestaethel.github.io/GenAI/Games/Simon-says/index.html)  
A classic memory game where you follow a sequence of colors and sounds. It was a fun challenge to implement the logic and visual effects for the game.

### 4. **Golden Depths**  
[Play the Game](https://tempestaethel.github.io/GenAI/Games/Golden-Depths/index.html)  
A maze adventure game set in a treasure-filled dungeon! I worked on refining the AI-generated level layout and made adjustments to the game mechanics for a smoother experience.
