# GenAI Repository

Welcome to the **GenAI** repository! This repository contains a collection of games, projects, and miscellaneous code that I generated using AI. While the code was created by AI, I dedicated time to make necessary corrections and modifications to ensure its functionality.

## Overview

This repository was created out of curiosity to explore how well code could be generated using AI. All the projects in this repository are hosted on GitHub Pages.

You can visit the main page of this repository and access all the projects through the link below:

## My Favorite Time-Spent Projects

Here are some of my favorite projects that I enjoyed working on:

- **Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe**: [Play the Game](https://tempestaethel.github.io/GenAI/Games/TicTacToe/index.html)  
  A Tic-Tac-Toe game that implements unbeatable AI. It was fun experimenting with the minimax algorithm to ensure the AI never loses!

- **Progress Knight**: [Play the Game](https://tempestaethel.github.io/GenAI/Games/Progress-knight/index.html)  
  A simple game where you progress through different levels. This project was a small mod, not AI-generated or coded by me, but I enjoyed making the tweaks.

- **Simon Says**: [Play the Game](https://tempestaethel.github.io/GenAI/Games/Simon-says/index.html)  
  A memory-based game where you follow a sequence of colors. Classic and fun!

- **Golden Depths**: [Play the Game](https://tempestaethel.github.io/GenAI/Games/Golden-Depths/index.html)  
  A fun adventure game set in a treasure-filled maze. The AI generated the basic layout, and I worked on refining it to make the gameplay more enjoyable.
